## It's year 1979,
 northern Czechoslovakia, under the communist regime. Karel, of 65 years, a history teacher, is sitting in his home, looking out the window with cigarette in his hand. The weather outside is murky, it's almost raining. Clouds are gray, blending in with the surroundings buildings, painted dark from coal smog in the air. Karel remembers the time before the regime - the freedom that he possessed for few years. He always remembers, it's always on his mind, like a worm stuck and growing in his cortex. Karel isn't a revolutionary. He prefers to stand in line, never thought of himself as anything else than a teacher in a small town school on a northern border with Poland. His fascination with history allowed him to possess deep understanding of when and where, but, he himself, rarely ever left his small town of Hronov. Never used that knowledge for anything.

## Something has to change...

Karel can no longer just stand by, and watch his life dissipate right in front of his very own eyes. He does have something on his mind, but he never went through with it. Always thought of it as an option that he will do "eventually". Eventually, his time to be the explorer. The adventurer, the rover. Though, as a historian, he himself wasn't sure if the underlying information, the main pillar holding up this idea of his, is real or not.

Is the hidden Hitler's underground city in the Owl Mountains real? A massive complex, dug from the core of the mountains, as a hideout for the Hitlers elite, was it every build or was it destroyed? He needed to know. This was the time to make the decision. Karel, through his own doing and his own thought, stopped, and realized that his heartbeat is pounding. He is stressed, because he knows that the decision has been already done, and he cannot undo it. It is the time, to finally set off to Owl Mountains.

## The Visual Style of Owl Moutains.

A little bit of a history here: The Owl Mountains was a supposed bunker complex that could house thousands of people, and it was build in Poland, in Owl Mountains, on a border with Czechoslovakia. There are a lot of stories and myths around this bunker, and it is a perfect environment and setting for a linear horror adventure experience. These stories are sometimes not so nice, though, it is a perfect opportunity for a game designer to feed off for inspiration.
- Apparently this complex could have thousands of people inside, but most is uknown, because of lack of documentation. This sets up the game to be "technically possible".
- It is told that Soviets blew up the entrances to the complex, trapping all the present populace inside. This is great setup for enemies that player might find in game. 
- There are stories that a Nazi "Bell" was present, which was supposedly used to enrich uranium. This gives opportunity for the typical trope "radiation = mutated stuff around". 
- The only thing that can grow in darkness are mushrooms. What if the people trapped inside actually survived on mushrooms?

In qua quid est boni praeter summam voluptatem, et eam sempiternam? Cur post Tarentum ad Archytam? Qua ex cognitione facilior facta est investigatio rerum occultissimarum. Negat enim tenuissimo victu, id est contemptissimis escis et potionibus, minorem voluptatem percipi quam rebus exquisitissimis ad epulandum. Non enim iam stirpis bonum quaeret, sed animalis. Qui autem esse poteris, nisi te amor ipse ceperit? Sic igitur in homine perfectio ista in eo potissimum, quod est optimum, id est in virtute, laudatur. Natura sic ab iis investigata est, ut nulla pars caelo, mari, terra, ut poëtice loquar, praetermissa sit; Eadem nunc mea adversum te oratio est. Mihi quidem Homerus huius modi quiddam vidisse videatur in iis, quae de Sirenum cantibus finxerit potionibus.

Sic igitur in homine perfectio ista in eo potissimum, quod est optimum, id est in virtute, laudatur. Natura sic ab iis investigata est, ut nulla pars caelo, mari, terra, ut poëtice loquar, praetermissa sit. Eadem nunc mea adversum te oratio est. Mihi quidem Homerus huius modi quiddam vidisse videatur in iis, quae de Sirenum cantibus finxerit. Neque enim disputari sine reprehensione nec cum iracundia aut pertinacia recte disputari potest. An, partus ancillae sitne in fructu habendus, disseretur inter principes civitatis. Put in geometria, prima si dederis, danda sunt omnia. Longum est enim ad omnia respondere.

Qua ex cognitione facilior facta est investigatio rerum occultissimarum. Negat enim tenuissimo victu, id est contemptissimis escis et potionibus, minorem voluptatem percipi quam rebus exquisitissimis ad epulandum. Non enim iam stirpis bonum quaeret, sed animalis. Qui autem esse poteris, nisi te amor ipse ceperit? Sic igitur in homine perfectio ista in eo potissimum, quod est optimum, id est in virtute, laudatur disputari sine.

Sin tantum modo ad indicia veteris memoriae cognoscenda, curiosorum. Haec et tu ita posuisti, et verba vestra sunt. Idemne potest esse dies saepius, qui semel fuit? Ampulla enim sit necne sit, quis non iure optimo irrideatur, si laboret? Ego vero volo in virtute vim esse quam maximam; Serpere anguiculos, nare anaticulas, evolare merulas, cornibus uti videmus boves, nepas aculeis. Archytam? Qua ex cognitione facilior facta est investiga.
