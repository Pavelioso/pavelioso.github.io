## What's going on here?

After game development I have a bit of an urge to really go into coding. Something that I can build logic with, but also, so it's something that I can build as an app. I like user interfaces too, soo...
I am learning Flutter!
Furthermore, I was missing a tool to view CSV benchmark data for (Frameview software from nVidia)[https://www.nvidia.com/cs-cz/geforce/technologies/frameview/]. So I built one.

## [FRAMEVIEWER](https://frameviewer-d74b1.web.app/#/)



## What I wanted to learn:

- Loading CSV Data to a Web App. This was quite difficult because all the guides are usually for mobile apps. Most packages don't work on web.

- Parsing CSV Data, and getting all the values nice and clean, so it can be presented. 

- Making data ready to be displayed as a chart. 

- How to host app on Firebase.



## What is next?

- Application States!


## Wish me luck!
