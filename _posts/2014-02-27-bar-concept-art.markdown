A friend of mine was building an underground club / bar, and he wanted something to present to potential investors. So, I came up with this. Unfortunately I never got the characters to "really" fit in the scene, though I believe it still looks pretty ok, for a 2-day job.

The modelling was done in Cinema 4D, all the textures were box mapped shaders, and Octane Render with triple GTX 1080s was used to render. Then, all the post production was finished in Photoshop.
