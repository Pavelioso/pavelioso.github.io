In game development, there is a rule, where one shouldn't force the player to read a wall of text, instead, leave it up to player's choice - quests and important game information is short, and non-important information is hidden for the player to find, which, usually is a wall of text. Since the current of the internet seas took you to an "about" page of myself, I will believe that you are the latter, though I present to you the choice - Either you can turn back, live as you lived, or you can chew through my babbling about me, and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

*My home, Tenerife.*

I'm Pavel Necas, and I'm a multi-talented creative professional with a diverse background in game development, production workflows, programming, 3D, VR, and product conception and realization. I know, it sounds like a lot, but trust me, it's been a wild ride. 

I started off as a 3D generalist and eventually found my way to the video mapping industry, where I wore many hats as a project manager, designer, concept artist, and programmer. It was a crazy time, but I loved every minute of it.

After that, I spent some time working on VR projects for clients, which was a really exciting and innovative field to be a part of. But then I discovered my true calling - game development. I spent a solid 8 years in the game industry, learning the ins and outs of 3D modeling, programming, audio design, and game design. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, and I loved being able to see my ideas come to life. I released one indie game!

These days, I'm all about programming and building products that make a real difference. I'm all about finding creative solutions that work well within budgets, and I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves and get the job done.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work in some amazing places like the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States, and the Czech Republic. It's been an incredible journey, and I'm grateful for all the experiences and the people I've met along the way.

Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I'm always up for new challenges and collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch!
