    I was tasked multiple times to create designs that are beatiful but also functional. This hobby turned to something that could be used 
    in multiple projects, is the main path I would like to embark on. I have designed a stage for a club in San Francisco, that was  modular and packable  
    to one van, aswell tables that could be reassembled without any screws, and further down the line objects for museums that I have made with my 3D printer.
